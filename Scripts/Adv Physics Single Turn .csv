Our task is to determine the height ($d_y$) above the water where the wall is located.\n\nWe will assume that the air resistance can be neglected and that the initial velocity is purely horizontal, i.e., the **vertical component of the velocity is zero**. Since the motion of the rock is similar to **semi-projectile motion**, the **horizontal velocity will be constant**, and the **horizontal acceleration will be zero**. The vertical acceleration will be the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nLet's also consider $x$ as the horizontal direction and $y$ as the vertical direction.\n\nWe first use the horizontal equation of motion to find the time it takes for the rock to reach the water:\n\n$S_x = u_xt + \\frac {1}{2}a_x t^2$\n\nHere, $S_x = 4.5 m$, $u_x = 3.0 m/s$, and $a_x = 0$. Substituting these values, we get:\n\n$4.5 = 3.0 \\times t + 0$\n\n$ t= 4.5 / 3.0$\n\n$t = 1.5 s$\n\nNow, we can use this time in the vertical equation of motion to find the height of the wall:\n\n$S_y = u_yt + \\frac{1}{2} a_yt^2$\n\nHere, $S_y = d_y$ (height of the wall), $u_y = 0$ (since the rock starts at rest), and $a_y = 9.8 m/s^2$ (acceleration due to gravity). Substituting $t = 1.5 s$, we get:\n\n$d_y = 0 \\times 1.5 + (\\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.8 \\times 1.5^2)$\n\n$d_y = 11.0 m$\n\nTherefore, the height of the wall above the water is **11.0 m**.\n\nFinal answer: The height of the wall above the water is 11.0 m, assuming the rock is thrown horizontally with an initial velocity of 3.0 m/s and neglecting the effect of air resistance.\n""",No Error,clp0q2mhh00q11apmgfp5c76a,65527492168482aa0093a631,Adv Physics Single Turn
