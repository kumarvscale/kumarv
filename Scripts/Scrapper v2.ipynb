The Smart Feed Automatic Pet Feeder lets you stay connected with your pet, allowing you to feed them dinner or a snack even when you're home or out and about.&lt;br&gt;Connect your PetSafe® smart pet feeder to Wi-fi and download the My PetSafe App to schedule, adjust and monitor your pet's feeding schedule right from your phone. You can access your smart feeder from multiple smartphones so every family member can download the My PetSafe® app and feed your furry best friend. This pet feeder also works with your Amazon Echo, so you can ask Alexa to feed your pet a snack.&lt;br&gt;With a 24-cup capacity, you won't have to refill the feeder after every meal. This pet feeder can dispense dry and semi-moist pet food thanks to the unique design of the conveyor that helps prevent food jams. This feeder also has low and empty food sensors, which will notify your smartphone when the pet feeder is running low or out of kibble. The Smart Feed Automatic Pet Feeder is compatible with Amazon Dash Replenishment to save you a trip to the store. With Amazon Dash Replenishment, the feeder will automatically reorder your pet's food when it senses it's low.&lt;br&gt;Meals can be scheduled up to 12 times daily in sizes from 1/8 cup to 4 cups per meal. And for those pets who tend to eat dinner like it's a race, you can use the ‘Slow Feed’ setting to dispense meals larger than 1/8 cup in small increments over 15 minutes. If you want to feed your pet an extra meal, or midnight snack, use the ‘Feed Now’ option within the app or push the pet-proof button on the top of the feeder.&lt;br&gt;This automatic cat and dog feeder comes with a stainless steel bowl and a bowl holder to keep your pet from nose booping the bowl and spilling kibble on the floor. When it's time to clean, place the stainless steel bowl, bowl holder, lid and hopper in the dishwasher to make clean-up quick and easy. Your pet deserves the best with every meal.
