      "The division of labor is a key concept in economics that refers to the idea of breaking down production processes into specialized tasks in order to increase productivity. This means that instead of one person trying to do everything, multiple people each focus on a specific task that they are good at doing. This specialization allows for greater efficiency and output. For example, in a factory, one person might be responsible for making a specific component of a product, while another person might be responsible for assembling the product. This way, each person can focus on their specific task and become an expert at it, leading to faster and more accurate production.<|end|>\n"

    "prompt = \"In the book 'The Wealth of Nations', Adam Smith mentions about the role of division of labor and specialization in increasing productivity. He argued that breaking down production processes into specialized tasks allows workers to become highly skilled in their specific roles, leading to greater efficiency and increased output. He mentions exactly this -- THE GREATEST IMPROVEMENTS in the productive powers of labour, and the greater part of the skill, dexterity, and judgment, with which it is anywhere directed, or applied, seem to have been the effects of the division of labour. The effects of the division of labour, in the general business of society, will be more easily understood, by considering in what manner it operates in some particular manufactures.
